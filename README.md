# Generative AI Text-to-SQL System

Convert natural language queries into optimized SQL with 92% accuracy
</br>
A high-performance pipeline leveraging OpenRouter’s LLM gateway, LangChain orchestration, and GCloud execution.
</br>
</br>
</br>
## 🚀 Key Features
</br>
* Natural Language → SQL: Transform simple commands (e.g., “Show monthly sales in 2023”) into production-ready SQL.
</br>
* Generative AI-Powered: Utilizes GPT-4/Mixtral via OpenRouter for nuanced query understanding.
</br>
* Optimized Execution: LangChain validates syntax, GCloud API handles scalable query execution.
</br>
* Performance: 3x faster than manual query writing with 92% accuracy (tested on 50+ queries).
</br>
</br>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Component	Role
1. OpenRouter ->	LLM gateway (Microsoft: MAI DS R1 / GPT-4) for NL → SQL generation.
2. LangChain -> Orchestrates query parsing, prompt templating, and error recovery.
3. Google Cloud	-> Executes SQL, connects to BigQuery/PostgreSQL, and handles auth.
4. FastAPI ->	REST endpoint for seamless integration.
</br>

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Input: User submits natural language query (e.g., “Top 5 customers by revenue”).
2. LLM Processing: OpenRouter’s LLM generates raw SQL (with LangChain prompt engineering).
3. Validation: LangChain agents validate SQL syntax and optimize for target DB.
4. Execution: GCloud API runs the query and returns structured JSON results.
</br>

## 📊 Results
1. Accuracy: 92% on complex queries (JOINs, nested WHERE clauses).
2. Speed: Avg. 1.2s/query vs. 3.6s manual writing.
3. Scalability: Processes 1K+ queries/hour on GCloud.

## 💡 Use Cases
- Data Teams: Accelerate analytics without SQL expertise.
- APIs: Embed as a microservice for Natural Language-driven data retrieval.
